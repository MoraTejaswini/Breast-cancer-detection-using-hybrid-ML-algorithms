# Breast-cancer-detection-using-hybrid-ML-algorithms
Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women globally. Early detection significantly improves survival rates. This project uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) to classify tumors as benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) using a hybrid machine learning approach.

Key methods include:

Data pre-processing: Outlier removal, normalization, and feature scaling to clean noisy and redundant data.
Dimensionality reduction using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to retain important features and improve performance.
Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM), achieving an accuracy of 96%.

The model identifies key risk indicators like cell shape, mitosis, and chromatin structure. Additional factors like age and family history are acknowledged as important. This study highlights the potential of machine learning to support early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook: `breast_cancer_detection.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter
2. Upload the dataset (`breast_cancer_data.csv`) if required
3. Run each cell step-by-step
4. View the confusion matrix and accuracy at the end
