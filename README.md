This project uses the WBCD dataset to predict breast cancer using PCA for dimensionality reduction and SVM for classification, achieving 96% accuracy. Preprocessing techniques like normalization and outlier removal were applied to enhance performance and identify key cancer risk features.
Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women globally. Early detection significantly improves survival rates. This project uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) to classify tumors as benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) using a hybrid machine learning approach.

Key methods include:

Data pre-processing: Outlier removal, normalization, and feature scaling to clean noisy and redundant data.
Dimensionality reduction using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to retain important features and improve performance.
Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM), achieving an accuracy of 96%.

The model identifies key risk indicators like cell shape, mitosis, and chromatin structure. Additional factors like age and family history are acknowledged as important. This study highlights the potential of machine learning to support early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.
